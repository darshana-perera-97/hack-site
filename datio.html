<p>
  To start adding a new item, go to the home screen within the app and select
  the '+ ADD ITEM' option.
</p>
----------------------------------------

<h3 class="blogHeading">Step 02 : Filling in Item Details</h3>
<p>
  When you choose to add an item, an item entry window will be displayed. Here's
  how you can categorize and fill in the details:
</p>

<h4 style="color: #339999">Required Fields</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b style="color: #339999">Item Name</b> - Enter the name of the item</li>
  <li><b style="color: #339999">Price</b> - Specify the price of the item</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4 style="color: #339999">Optional Fields</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Barcode</b> - If available, you can enter the
    item's barcode. Users of the Datio POS base station have the added
    convenience of scanning the item to automatically fill in this field
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Seq ID</b> - Use this field to arrange the order
    of menu items on the home page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Color Tag</b> - Assign a color tag to the item for
    easy identification or categorization.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Add Taxes</b> - Specify whether the item is
    subject to VAT at checkout or if it is exempt from VAT and other taxes
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Measure by Unit</b> - Check this option if the
    item is quantified by a specific unit (e.g., grams)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Prompt for Price</b> - Select this box if you want
    to add generic items like 'Drinks,' 'Beer,' or 'Chips,' and the system will
    prompt for the price upon selection. For stores with a large inventory who
    prefer not to add each item individually, our bulk upload feature is ideal.
    Simply send us your spreadsheet, and we'll handle the addition of thousands
    of items for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Gift Card</b> - Select this box to categorize the
    new item as a Gift Card for Sale.
  </li>
</ul>
----------------------------------------

<h3 class="blogHeading">Step 03 : Modifiers</h3>
<p>
  In Datio POS, item modifiers allow you to add options or variations to a
  product, enhancing its appeal and functionality. For example, when selling a
  piece of apparel, you can introduce modifiers for size, color, or material.
</p>
<p>To incorporate these modifications</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Begin by selecting your product, then access the 'Modifiers' option from the
    item menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    To open the item menu, either click on 'ADD ITEM' or press and hold an
    existing product to enter edit mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add your desired modifiers, such as 'Size: S, M, L, XL', 'Color: Red, Blue,
    Green', or 'Material: Cotton, Polyester'. These modifiers can easily
    customize your product offering.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable notes for special requests or instructions, like 'Gift wrap' or
    'Include a greeting card'.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modifiers can either adjust the product's price or be set at no additional
    cost ($0.00).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This feature is tailored to cater to the diverse needs of retail operations,
  allowing for an enhanced and personalized shopping experience
</p>
----------------------------------------
<p>
  When you select an item for sale, 'Blue Shirt' in this example, a pop-up will
  prompt you to specify the size modifier, such as 'S', 'M', 'L' or 'XL'. This
  ensures the exact variant is selected according to the customer's preference
</p>
----------------------------------------
<p>
  The cart will display the selected modifiers, and the total price will adjust
  to include the cost of these modifiers. Both the notes and modifiers will be
  printed on the customer's receipt.
</p>
----------------------------------------

<h3 class="blogHeading">Step 04 : Quantity</h3>
<p>
  The 'Quantity' section in the Item Window is designed for comprehensive
  inventory management:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Item Cost</b> - Enter your purchase cost for the
    item, enabling the system to automatically calculate your profit margins
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Quantity Available</b> - Specify how many units of
    each item you currently have in stock
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Restock Threshold</b> - Set the inventory level
    that triggers a reminder to reorder the item
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Receive SMS/Email Alerts</b> - Enable
    notifications to be sent when inventory falls below the Restock Threshold,
    reminding you it's time to reorder.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Supplier Name</b> - Record the name of the
    supplier for each item, making it easier to know whom to contact for
    restocking.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b style="color: #339999">Supplier Phone Number</b> - Keep your supplier's
    contact number handy for easy communication when it's time to replenish your
    stock
  </li>
</ul>
----------------------------------------

<h3 class="blogHeading">Step 05 : Completing the Setup</h3>
<p>
  After entering all the necessary information, you will be presented with a few
  options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add the item to the cart and save it</li>
  <li>Save the item details without adding it to the cart</li>
  <li>Add the item to the cart without saving the details</li>

  Step 06 : Understanding and Using Colored Dots for Item Categorization
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The colored dots located on the left panel serve as a straightforward visual
    tool for categorizing items within your inventory. By assigning a specific
    color to different categories of items, you can organize your offerings more
    efficiently
  </li>
  <li>
    Selecting a colored dot filters the displayed items on the home page menu to
    only those assigned to the chosen color category. For broader search
    criteria, you have the option to select multiple colors simultaneously,
    allowing the system to display items that match any of the selected color
    categories
  </li>
  <li>
    In the example provided, selecting both purple and gold colors results in
    the menu displaying only items that belong to these categories
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This streamlined process ensures that you can efficiently manage your
  inventory and sales directly from the X POS App. Now let's get selling
